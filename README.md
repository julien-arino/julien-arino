- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @julien-arino
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematical biology and in particular, mathematical epidemiology and population dynamics.
- I teach about mathematical epidemiology a bit all over the place and generate [slides](https://julien-arino.github.io/teaching/) and (sometimes) videos about this.
- I am also interested in the use of the `R` programming language, in particular for [modelling](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/).
- ðŸ“« To reach me, see the contact info on [my GitHub page](https://julien-arino.github.io)
